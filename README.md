# ETL-Project

Project Topic: Wine Selection based on Reviews & Quality

Team Members: Andrew Giermak, Nirupama Shankar, Rachael Songalewski

Summary of Data: This data source provided datasets that include a summary of wine reviews from various regions and the quality of wine types. It includes various aspects of the wine such as the region of origin, points, rating, price, etc. We decided to extract key pieces of information from these files, and load it into a database that would include relevant pieces of information that may be useful to a customer to make a decision regarding the wine (for consumption/purchase). 

Type of Database: SQL

Data Sources & Datasets: Kaggle is our primary data source. We selected the CSV from the “Majestic Wine Data” dataset (Majestic_Wine_Data.csv), a CSV from the “Wine Reviews” dataset (winemag-data-130k-v2), and a CSV from the “Wine-Price-Rating” dataset (white-wine-price-rating.csv). We created a merged/concatenated dataset from all 3 CSV’s called “df2”.
